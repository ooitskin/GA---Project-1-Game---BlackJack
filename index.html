      <h3>THE PACK</h3>
      The standard 52-card pack is used, but in most casinos several decks of cards are shuffled together.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>OBJECT OF THE GAME</h3>
      Each participant attempts to beat each other by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h3>CARD VALUES/SCORING</h3>
      An ace is worth 1 or 11. Kings, Queens, & Jacks are worth 10 and any other card is its card value.
    </p>

      <u>How To Play</u>
    </h2>
    <h3>TO START</h3>
    <p>To start the game, Click the 'Aces' above to play! Then click the 'Deal' button to deal 2 cards to each player.</p>
    <p>Each player will then have the options to 'Hit' (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or
      even hit 21 exactly) or 'Stay', (not ask for another card). If the player goes over 21, the player 'Busts' or 'Loses'
      and that's the end of the round.</p>
    <h3>TO WIN</h3>
    <p>To win, a player must have the higher total than the other player and/or have a total of 21 points. If both players have
      the same amount of points, then it's a 'push' or a tie.</p>
